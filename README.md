# peeling-taskplanning

This repository contains a domain and problem file written in PDDL
to map out the task of picking up and peeling a food item with a
robotic arm, peeler, and a cutting board. 

The plan is found using the fully observable non-deterministic (FOND) planner
Planner for Relevant Policies (PRP). The outputs of the plan are located in the
_policy_output_ folder in the format of a policy. The output is the _output.sas_
file while the raw policy produced is the file _policy.out_. Using the 
translator _translator.py_, a human readable output file is created named º
_readable_output.txt_.

### Planutils
The planner PRP is installed/accessed through the Planutils library.

GitHub Repo: https://github.com/AI-Planning/planutils

### PRP
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/QuMuLab/planner-for-relevant-policies
The _translator.py_ file is a copy of planner-for-relevant-policies/prp-scripts/translate_policy.py 
with a few minor changes so that the output is printed in the _readable_output.txt_ file.
